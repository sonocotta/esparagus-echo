Esparagus Echo is a series of two ESP32-S3-based voice control edge devices. They are designed to work with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) as an edge part of the voice control pipeline. Both devices are enclosed in a neat-looking aluminum case and expose feedback LEDs on the front panel where it is easy to spot them, leaving power and speaker connectors on the backside.

## Why Esparagus

The Esparagus Echo design shares a lot with the earlier [Esparagus](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center) series of devices, using similar parts and the same pinout whenever possible. I see this as a side branch of the series, therefore.

## Motivation

I'm a big fan of Alexa. I'm using it around the house, and my family is using it all the time, including 2 years old. However, I do not need to mention privacy concerns, these are quite common. My biggest pain point is the inability to integrate Alexa into the Home Assistant setup that I have at home. I'm a big fan of automation around the house and want to trigger complex flows based on the specific sensors and devices that I have. I think the freedom of the implementation is a bit like the magic of the Home Assistant. Why not have voice control, since everyone around the house is used to it already?

## Esparagus Solo

Esparagus Solo has all the basic necessities, a Mic on the front panel, a couple of feedback LEDs, and a speaker at the back. Onboard is a simple and well-known MAX98357 DAC with a reasonable 5W of output audio. It uses a built-in antenna for simplicity. And that's pretty much it.

## Esparagus Duo

On top of Solo capabilities, Esparagus Duo uses a dual Mic setup, extra LED, and most importantly 2-channels MAX98357 channels to deliver quality stereo-audio (and thus can be used as a media player device). To make sure it would stream audio without a hiccup it uses an external Wifi antenna (much-improved perception) and has SPI Ethernet for the most robust networking.

## Software

Since both devices are designed to be primarily used within the Home Assistant setup, the [software](/firmware) folder contains ESPHome configurations for both devices.
- `media-player` is a simple external speaker based on the Arduino framework
- `voice-assistans` is a work-in-progress configuration based on esp-adf pipeline and wake-word detection. 

### Home Assistant - media player

One simple way Esparagus Echo can be used in the Home Assistant is a media player device. [Yaml config](/firmware/esphome) will get you started. Below are configuration steps that you need to do in the HA itself.

| Step | Screenshot |
|------|------------|
| **Add ESPHome Addon** <br/> <br/> Navigate to HA Settings > Addons > Add Addon <br/> Search for SSH and install it.  <br/> Enable `Show in sidebar` switch while you there | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/9d9d0a44-ba2a-491f-bff8-e1c08b8754e0)
| **Prepare Esparagus Echo for ESPHome onboarding** <br/> <br/> Use [Web Flasher](https://web.esphome.io/?dashboard_wizard) to flash stock ESPHome into device | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/8ad222e8-d992-4a75-9a93-596d67ac8cb0)
| **Onboard Esparagus Echo ESPHome device into HA** <br/> <br/> Go to the HA ESPHome page and you should be able to find a new device. You need to onboard it with the below config (feel free to change names) <br/> This will take a moment or two | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/32b0c26a-3be1-4e15-b749-1176d46ff011)
| **Validate device in the ESPHome** | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/92df6029-c777-47ce-8ff9-debec70f7e05)
| **Add ESPHome Integration** <br /> <br/> Navigate to HA Settings > Devices & services > Integrations. Click the big + ADD INTEGRATION button, look for ESPHome, and click to add it. <br/> It should discover and add ESPHome media devices based on the previous step | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/c5d3bb12-8b07-4c49-a9e9-cdf2e6cad8ba)
| **Use your media device in the HA** | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/40067959-04ad-498c-a64d-4353e3f96228)
| **Use your media device in the MA** <br/> <br/> Add Music Assistant HA MediaPlayers provider to discover new Media device | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/6d19a972-83cf-4997-868c-1af0e4175c9b)
